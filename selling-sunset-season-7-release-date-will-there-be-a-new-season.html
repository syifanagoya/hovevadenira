Thanks to its gorgeous cast and interesting dramas, Selling Sunset now has many fans. It has, however, been dogged by allegations that it is scripted. Is this true or false? Come with me as we delve into it.</p><h2><strong>Is Selling Sunset Coming Back?</strong></h2><p>Selling Sunset is indeed coming back for a new season, either in late 2023 or early 2024. Back in June 2022, just a month after the 5th season finished airing, the producers of the show confirmed that there was not just going to be a season 6 but also a season 7. Season 6 of Selling Sunset aired in May 2023, while filming started on season 7 back in March 2023. There is every possibility that filming has since wrapped up, and we can now patiently look forward to a new season.</p><h2><strong>When Is the Next Season of Selling Sunset Coming Out?</strong></h2><p>The next season of Selling Sunset that will come out is Season 7, and there is no official release date for it yet. What is known is that filming started on Season 7 of Selling Sunset in March 2023. It is quite likely that filming has finished now as a cast member, Christine Quinn, once revealed that they have a tight filming schedule. Given all this, it is expected that Selling Sunset Season 7 will either be released in late 2023 or early 2024.</p><h2><strong>How Many Selling Sunset Season 7 Episodes Will There Be?</strong></h2><p>Season 7 of Selling Sunset will likely have about 11 episodes, which is what the past two seasons had. Seasons 5 and 6 both had 11 episodes. However, it is a different ball game if we go further back in the history of the show. Seasons 1, 2, and 3 had eight episodes, while season 4 had 10 episodes.</p><h2><strong>Selling Sunset Season 7 Cast</strong></h2><ul><li>Jason Oppenheim</li><li>Heather El Moussa</li><li>Mary Fitzgerald</li><li>Brett Oppenheim</li><li>Chrishell Stause</li><li>Romain Bonnet</li><li>Davina Potratz</li><li>Nicole Young</li><li>Bre Tiesi</li><li>Chelsea Lazkani</li><li>Emma Hernan</li><li>Amanza Smith</li></ul><h2><strong>Is Selling Sunset Real or Fake?</strong></h2><p>The answer to this puzzle depends on whom you are asking. There are well-known personalities who have argued that Selling Sunset is <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">scripted</a> or outrightly fake. The cast members of the show, however, maintain that they are actually a bunch of realtors dealing in real estate.</p><p>Back in August 2020, Chrissy Teigen Tweeted that she was very active on the L.A. real estate scene but had never run into any of the realtors on Selling Sunset. She also stated that her agents also have a similar view.</p><p>Also, a TikTok user named Petite Sayo has come out to claim that she listed her home with Jason Oppenheim but that on Selling Sunset, the portrayal was that she listed it with Christine Quinn, which was false as she never met Quinn. The Tik Toker also pointed out that on the show, the claim was that the owner of the house was a male plastic surgeon who was away in Europe. She pointed out that these were untrue as she was not male, nor a plastic surgeon, nor was she away in Europe at the time.</p><p>The Oppenheim brothers, in response, have clarified that when they get a listing, they can give it to any of the realtors working for them. They also pointed out that L.A. was quite big, and as such, it wasn’t such an anomaly that neither Teigen nor her agents had run into one of the cast members of Selling Sunset.</p><p>One of the cast members of Selling Sunset, Christin Quinn, has admitted that the storyboarders often gossip with the cast members about their fellow stars just to make emotions run high and create drama. The verdict is that certain aspects of Selling Sunset are scripted but that the show is not entirely fake. The Oppenheim Group is a well-known real estate company in Los Angeles</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>Is Selling Sunset Real or Scripted?</strong></h3><p>Selling Sunset has some scripted aspects, as is common with reality TV shows, but the show is real. The cast members are really realtors buying and selling houses.</p><h3><strong>How Many Seasons of Selling Sunset Are There?</strong></h3><p>There are currently six seasons of Selling Sunset, and there will definitely be a 7th season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2Bosq24yKeeZqulo8CmwIysnJqrn6N6eHnRnqOemaOaeqWt055ksKGcoXq1tMSrnGaalWKubrrEsGSsnZGovK97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./markus-flasch-bmw-net-worth-how-much-does-he-earn.html><span>←</span><span>Markus Flasch BMW Net Worth: How Much Does He Earn?</span></a>
