He didn’t share much about his family, parents, or whether he had siblings. What we do know is that he started working at a very young age and took on various jobs before he ventured into the world of moonshining.</p><p>At just 15 years old, Jim Tom began his moonshining career as a sugar supplier. He would haul sugar by boat to a national park where his employer operated a distillery. However, he soon realized he could make moonshine on his own. To make ends meet, he took on other jobs as well, working as a plumber, electrician, and ham radio operator, and even tried his hand at singing, releasing a few country songs, including the hit “Golly That’s Good.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/steven-tickle-2-min.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jim_Tom_The_Rise_to_Prominence></span><strong>Jim Tom</strong> <strong>The Rise to Prominence</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jim Tom’s unwavering dedication to moonshining paid off when he became a part of the popular Discovery Channel series “Moonshiners.” Alongside other moonshiners like Josh Owens, Tim Smith, and Mark Rogers, he became a prominent reality TV personality. His product, ‘100 Proof Unaged Rye,’ gained attention across the United States and beyond. This success led to corporate opportunities, and he struck an endorsement deal with the Sugarland Distilling Company to sell his moonshine.</p><p>For several years, Jim Tom was a regular face on the show, but he made fewer appearances after 2016. Many speculated that his health was deteriorating, even suggesting that he might have passed away, as there was no news about him for a while.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jim_Tom_Health_and_the_Accident></span><strong>Jim Tom Health and the Accident</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jim Tom is now approaching his 90th birthday, and it’s only natural that he has experienced some health decline. However, he’s not dead; he’s just slowed down a bit. He faced a horrific accident in 1962 at the age of 22. On Halloween night, he and his girlfriend’s sister’s husband engaged in a reckless race. Jim was riding a 1961 Starliner 390 at over 115mph when he collided with a 1955 Ford Station Wagon coming towards him. The collision left him with a head injury and a broken leg. Miraculously, doctors managed to save him, and he left the hospital with stitches in his head and a steel rod in his leg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/maxresdefault-14-1024x512.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jim_Tom_Net_Worth></span><strong>Jim Tom Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Throughout his life, Jim Tom held various jobs that contributed to his net worth. However, it was in 2012, when he joined the cast of “Moonshiners,” that his net worth began to rise significantly. As of early 2019, Jim Tom’s net worth was estimated to be around $200,000—a testament to his enduring career and the success of his moonshine product.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jim_Tom_Personal_Life_and_Rumors></span><strong>Jim Tom Personal Life and Rumors</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jim Tom was known for his storytelling, but he kept the most crucial details of his personal life a well-guarded secret. It’s unclear whether he ever married or had children. What is known, however, is that Jim Tom often found himself in trouble with law enforcement officers. Ironically, most of his run-ins with the law were for being drunk, often on his own moonshine. Despite investigations, no illegal activity was found in his moonshine production, and he was usually released from jail after being arrested for drunkenness or disorderly conduct.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jim_Tom_Hedrick_Legacy></span><strong>Jim Tom Hedrick Legacy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moonshiners-bio-jim-tom-promo.jpg><p>Jim Tom Hedrick, also known as Jim Tom Hedrick, left an indelible mark in the world of moonshining and reality TV.
