This was certainly not TBS’ fault.</p><p>During the October 28th episode of AEW Collision, they promoted the main event match during the show. The graphic for MJF vs Kenny Omega featured text under it which read, “Still to Oome Tonight.” Eagle-eyed fans caught that error, and they had a bit of fun with it on social media.</p><p>Fans will remember botches during AEW matches, but there have also been mistakes in other departments. <a href=#>We can’t forget the issue</a> with sound during that Adam Cole segment, and AEW had to re-run the vignette later on in the show.</p><p>AEW has done a lot to keep fans from sharing unflattering clips. They directed <a href=#>takedown notices at popular social media accounts dedicated to doing just that</a>. In the end, it didn’t win them too many favors with certain sections of the fan base.</p><p>We will have to see if AEW can correct this kind of thing in the future. It’s pretty hard to be perfect, but Tony Khan’s company is going to keep trying.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on this mistake from AEW?
