The actor told her son about her relationship with her close friend, Clare Munn. "I didn't think of it as romantic or sexual," Bello wrote. "She was one of the most beautiful, charming, brilliant, and funny people I had ever met, but it didn't occur to me that we could perhaps choose to love each other romantically," Bello actor wrote.</p><p dir=ltr>This conversation helped Bello realize her feelings for Munn. "I had become involved with a woman who was my best friend," she recalled in the Times piece. This altered how Bello viewed romantic relationships. "I would like to consider myself a 'whatever,' ... Whomever I love, however I love them," she wrote. A couple of years later, she wrote a memoir about the experience, <a href=# rel=sponsored class=norewrite>"Whatever...Love Is Love: Questioning the Labels We Give Ourselves."</a></p><p dir=ltr>Bello would define her sexual identity as "W" in the book, which stood for "Whatever." Her main focus was not defining herself but helping others embrace openness. "I felt like it was my responsibility to continue that conversation," she told the <a href=#>Advocate</a> in 2015. "Give me any label you want to help advance human rights," Bell added. She would end up falling in love with another person who was passionate about women's rights.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2ljZoZ0e9OhnGaln6Kyr8CMrZ%2BarF2YtaK6xp6bZp2mmr%2B6wMeipaBllqS%2FbrrCoqpmq6SWv265wKugmmWSmrmtu44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./37262-taylor-swifts-2014-vma-performance-proves-her-pop-music-revolution-is-off-to-a-shaky-start.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift's 2014 VMA Performance Proves Her Pop Music Revolution is Off to a Shaky Start VIDE</span></a>
