He was raised in many mid-west and east coast cities, including Mount Vernon, New York, Wilkes-Barre, Nanticoke, and Scranton, in Pennsylvania, Springfield, Massachusetts, and Waukegan, Illinois.</p><p>He was married to stage and musical theatre actress and director Elaine Cancilla Orbach, until his death. He had two children, including actor, singer, and songwriter Chris Orbach, with his former wife Marta Curro.</p><p>Jerry had evidently stated that his father had Sephardi Jewish ancestry. It is not clear if this is accurate.</p><p>Jerry’s paternal grandfather was named Isidore Orbach (the son of Lesser Orbach and Annie). Isidore was born in Neustettin, Germany, today in Szczecinek, Poland.</p><p>Jerry’s paternal grandmother was named Bertha.

Suzanne was a Catholic emigrant, from Lithuania. Stanley was the son of John Klauba and Elizabeth Swentecki.</p><p>The book Jerry Orbach, Prince of the City, 2011, by John Anthony Gilvey, states that “Susanna’s mother [Jerry’s matrilineal great-grandmother] was a Jewish orphan who had been raised by a Lithuanian Catholic family.” It is not clear if this information has been verified/documented.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong> <a href=#>https://news.google.com</a></p><p>Genealogy of Jerry Orbach – <a href=#>https://www.geni.com</a></p><p>Jerry’s mother on the 1920 U.S. Census – <a href=#>https://familysearch.org</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJ27qq%2FEpZybq16YvK57yZ6pq7FdpL%2BjrcKh</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miss-universe-moraya-wilson-parents-who-are-they-family-ethnicity-and-origin.html><span>←</span><span>Miss Universe Moraya Wilson Parents: Who Are They?
