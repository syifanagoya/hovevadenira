<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Taylor Swift and Brittany Mahomes Cheer On Chiefs Together</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The Kansas City Chiefs may have a cheerleading squad, but <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong></a> have become the team’s biggest supporters.</p><p>Swift, 33, and Brittany, 28, traveled to Wisconsin to cheer on their respective partners, <strong>Travis Kelce</strong> and Patrick Mahomes, at the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs game</a> against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday, December 3.</p><p>The BFFs arrived at Lambeau Field in <a href=#>coordinating looks</a>, with Swift sporting a long red teddy coat over a black dress and boots. Brittany, meanwhile, repped her husband by wearing his jersey number on the back of her black and red <a href=#>bomber jacket</a>.</p><p>Some fans suspect that Swift borrowed her red coat from Brittany, as it looks nearly identical to one Brittany wore to a Chiefs game in November 2022. The coat could also have been borrowed from <strong>Lyndsay Bell</strong>, wife of Chiefs tight end <strong>Blake Bell</strong>, as she wore a similar red fuzzy jacket while seated in a box with Swift and Brittany.</p><p>In the stands, Swift and Brittany were seen cheering, hugging and clapping as the Chiefs scored a total of 19 points. The team ultimately lost the game to the Packers, breaking the Chiefs’ streak of winning every game that <a href=#>Swift has attended</a>. Swift, Brittany and Lyndsay were later seen leaving the stadium together.</p><p>Sunday’s game marked the first game Swift attended since the team’s <a href=#>October 22 matchup</a> against the Los Angeles Chargers. At that game, she also sat alongside Brittany in a suite.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Taylor-Swift-and-Brittany-Mahomes-Cheer-Their-Hearts-Out-for-Their-NFL-Men-at-Chiefs-Packers-Game.jpg><p>Since Swift <a href=#>began dating Kelce</a>, 34, in September, the pop star has welcomed Brittany into her close-knit circle of <a href=#>celebrity friends</a>. In addition to hanging out at Chiefs games, Brittany has also joined Swift and her crew for a handful of <a href=#>nights out</a> in New York City.</p><p>“Brittany is having a blast hanging out with Taylor and her friends,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> last month. “She loves making new friends and loves how down-to-earth <strong>Sophie</strong> [<strong>Turner</strong>], <strong>Gigi</strong> [<strong>Hadid</strong>], <strong>Selena</strong> [<strong>Gomez</strong>] and <strong>Cara</strong> [<strong>Delevingne</strong>] all are.”</p><p>Swift is having just as fun a time getting to know more of her fellow Chiefs wives and girlfriends. She hosted an NFL watch party for Brittany, Lyndsay and <strong>Paige Buechele</strong> (wife of former Chiefs backup quarterback <strong>Shane Buechele</strong>) at her NYC apartment on November 5.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Taylor-Swift-and-Brittany-Mahomes-Cheer-Their-Hearts-Out-for-Their-NFL-Men-at-Chiefs-Packers-Game-3.jpg><p>“Taylor is loving her newfound friendships with the other wives and girlfriends of Travis’ teammates,” a second insider shared with <a href=#>Us</a>. “She appreciates that they know how to have fun just like she does and she loves cheering Travis and the Chiefs on alongside all of them.”</p><p>The source added that Swift’s celeb pals have “got along amazingly” with the Chiefs women, adding, “She absolutely has plans on hanging out all together very soon.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdlrulecGroK2skaPGbrnAoaamnaNisKmxxKtkqKZdmLWqscWsZK2nl5rBqbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hailey-bieber-regrets-getting-this-violent-tattoo-at-18.html><span>←</span><span>Hailey Bieber Regrets Getting Tattoo at 18</span></a>
