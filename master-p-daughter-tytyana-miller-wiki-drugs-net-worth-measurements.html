Miller, whose nationality is American, is best known as one of the seven children of Master P and his ex-wife Sonya Miller, who are both active in the music field.</p><h2><span id=Drugs>Drugs</span></h2><p>Reportedly, Tytyana ran away from home when she found out her parents were divorcing. In one episode of “Growing Up Hip Hop”, the audience was able to see her discuss her drug problem with her dad, who told her that in his house she’s “gonna have to do what’s right for her”.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span></h2><p>So just how rich is Tytyana Miller as of early 2019? According to authoritative sources, Miller has a net worth of over $1 million, whereas her father, a critically appraised rapper, actor, businessman and former basketball player has a net worth of around $360 million, which certainly played an important role in the family’s finances, including Tytyana’s. She hasn’t disclosed any information regarding her assets, such as houses and cars, but being born into a wealth family, Tytyana is certainly financially supported.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tytyana-miller-is-a-celebraty-daughter-1.jpg><h2><span id=Ethnicity_and_Background>Ethnicity and Background</span></h2><p>When it comes to Miller’s ethnicity, she is black and has dark hair and eyes, which suits her complexion perfectly. Judging from the photos available on the internet, Tytyana has a fit figure and looks well put together at events she attends. Unfortunately, she hasn’t shared much about her early life and formative years, including about her education. Nor is she active on any social media, which makes it harder for her fans to reach out to her. Despite being born into a famous family, Tytyana prefers keeping some things a secret, and doesn’t share much about her love life and relationship status.</p><h2><span id=Father_Master_P_Career>Father Master P Career</span></h2><p>Tytyana’s dad, Percy Robert Miller and known as Master P, made his music debut in 1991, releasing the album entitled “Get Away Clean”. In the next year, he worked on “Mama’s Bad Boy”, and in 1994 released the album entitled “The Ghettos Tryin to Kill Me!”, featuring 16 songs such as “Late Night Creepin”, “Study Being for a Gangsta” and the title song made in collaboration with Silkk the Shocker. In 2000, Master P made “Ghetto Postage”, consisting of songs such as “Golds in They Mouth”, “Pockets Gone’ Stay Fat” and “It Don’t Get No Better” and in 2001 he released “Game Face”, followed by working on “Good Side, Bad Side” in 2004. As of 2005, Percy worked on his 12th studio album, entitled “Ghetto Bill”. Overall, Tytyana’s dad has made 14 studio albums, which has allowed him to make a name for himself, and gain many more fans.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span id=Mother_Sonya_Miller_Career>Mother Sonya Miller Career</span></h2><p>As we have mentioned, Tytyana’s family is music-oriented, and her mother is a rapper as well. Speaking about her career, her mom worked on the album entitled “Married to the Mob” in 1993, featured songs such as “Life Ain’t Nothing But A Game”, “No Credit” and “Gankers”, but which received a mediocre response,. As of 1997, she released another album under the title “True to the Game”, and then made “Da Crime Family” in 1999 and “The Best of TRU” in 2005.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>Tytyana’s father is active on social media, such as Twitter, where he’s followed by more than 170,000 people who enjoy his content. Some of his latest tweets include a <a rel=nofollow href=#>post dedicated to his father</a>. In addition, he posted a photo of Tytyana’s brother Percy, a basketball player, saying that hard work pays off and adding “Put God first and all your dreams will come true. Nobody can stop you but you. Forget about yesterday – today is a new start”. Besides that, her sister Cymphonique Miller, who is also a signer, is active on Instagram and has almost 150,000 followers. One of her latest posts on that social media is a video of her and her friends dancing.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nobody has the power to change the past, but we all have the power to change the future.
