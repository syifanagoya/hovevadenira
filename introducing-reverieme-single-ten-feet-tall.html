Not only are some of the biggest names&nbsp;in the world currently dropping hit after hit after hit, but there are also some really amazing&nbsp;up and coming artists&nbsp;who are definitely going to be making waves in the music industry with their latest tracks. Reverieme is one of these artists. And if her newest single, “Ten Feet Tall,” is anything to go by then she is well on her way to becoming a huge star. But before we let you listen to it, allow us introduce you to the person behind that incredible voice.</p><p>Scottish singer and songwriter Louise Connell founded indie-pop act Reverieme way back in 2005. Initially, she recorded and performed under the name Reverie but eventually she decided to lengthen the moniker to the current one. And we love it! Reverieme is such a unique name which fits perfectly with the act itself. On her&nbsp;<a href=#>Facebook page</a>, Reverieme is described as, “a musical act that looks mostly like Louise Connell and sounds mostly like pop,” which we think is absolutely brilliant.</p><p>Reverieme has a very distinctive sound and her music derives from myriad novels, plays, and poems so it is very endearing and it almost has that timeless quality to it&nbsp;which isn’t often seen in the charts these days. But don’t just take our word for it… Reverieme has already performed at some of the biggest festivals including T In The Park, Wickerman, and Edinburgh’s The Edge, had airplay on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 6, and toured with artists Gotye, Newton Faulker, Roses, and Kings to name a few.</p><p>Reverieme may have a lot of experience in the music industry, but she also has enough genuine talent to make it big on her own terms and her latest single, “Ten Feet Tall,” is a testament to that. Her passion for literature and her mastery of language really shines through and when these things are combined with such unique melodies and innovative tones, they create something really wonderful and something which we predict is going to make some big moves once more people hear it.</p><p>You can listen to, “Ten Feet Tall,” right here:</p><p><a href=#>https://soundcloud.com/reverieme/sets/ten-feet-tall-single/s-wZfaP</a></p><p>We love it! The song just makes you feel good and everything from the lyrics, to the tone of Reverieme’s voice, to the overall composition of the music behind it is pure perfection.</p><p>If you can’t get enough of Reverieme then you should&nbsp;check out her current&nbsp;album, “Straw Woman,” or you can sign up to the mailing list on her <a href=#>website</a> to make sure you are first in line to know about any of her upcoming projects.</p><p>Reverieme is also currently on tour and if you would like to see her perform&nbsp;then you can buy tickets for the following dates.</p><p>13th April at La Belle Angele in Edinburgh<br>17th April at String Theory in Hawick<br>26th April at The Garage in Glasgow<br>29th April at the Parish Hall in London<br>30th April at The Hug and Pint in Glasgow<br>12th May at the State Bar in Glasgow</p><p><strong>What do you think of Ten Feet Tall?
