This copyright infringement was recognized and identified moments after the release of “Do You” off the Black Love album by Sarkodie featuring Mr. Eazi most recently.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190817_064859_735.jpg><p>Historically, Ne-Yo released the original version of the song under discussion, “Do You” in somewhere 2007.<strong> Almost 12 years down the line, Sarkodie perhaps thinks his smartness level is beyond human comprehension as he has copied verbatim the chorus used by Ne-Yo and used it as his bona-fide property.</strong></p><p>Regardless Nigerian Mr. Eazi did justice to the chorus of Sarkodie’s “Do You” and we can’t establish the fact or whatsoever for now if Sarkodie wrote the chorus for Mr. Eazi or the Nigerian artiste ignorantly or intentionally jumped on Ne-Yo’s lines like he owns it.</p><p>Irrespective of who wrote the chorus, the song belongs to Sarkodie, therefore, Mr. Eazi can’t be necessary blamed unlike the SarkCess Music CEO.</p><p>Truthfully, this issue of copyright infringement is very unfortunate taking into consideration the caliber of Sarkodie in Ghana music including Africa, it’s therefore shameful for him to engage in music theft otherwise known as song sampling.</p><h4><strong>WATCH VIDEO below for personal assessment, analysis and fair judgement.</strong></h4><p><a href=#>https://youtu.be/DY8MvgXSGC0</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC%2FwKuiqJyZmnqir8Kuqp6cXaSzbrnUrKCcZaSdsqfAjJqknqqZmK6vecCrq6KrpJp6r7GMsqZmoaNiwamxjKipop%2BZo66tecKopKmno5q%2FbrvFZpuoZamkwm6t0maqmqqbYrCwvMiem2asmJp6pLTOq6ysZaaav6Ot06KkZq6ZmbKwew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./master-p-daughter-tytyana-miller-wiki-drugs-net-worth-measurements.html><span>←</span><span>Master P Daughter, Tytyana Miller, Wiki, Drugs, Net Worth, Measurements</span></a>
