During the interview, she reacted to her nomination and her appreciation for The Young and the Restless fans.</p><h3>Sharon Case Joins Leading Ladies Club</h3><p>Per Soap Central, Sharon Case received her first nomination for Lead Actress at the Daytime Emmy Awards. She spoke to the outlet about how she felt about joining the Leading Ladies Club.</p><p>“This is something that I’ve been working hard for a long time, and I’m really, really happy to have achieved the nomination,” Sharon Case told Soap Central’s Dan J. Kroll.</p><p><a href=#>She’s played the role of Sharon Newman for 30 years.</a> The actress found it hard to believe that she received a nomination for her performance on the CBS daytime soap. Sharon is ecstatic to be part of the club for the first time ever.</p><p>“I hadn’t had any nominations for a long time, so that makes it all the more special,” Sharon explained. “I’m just thrilled that I get to go to the Emmys in this category with all of my colleagues who are also nominated. It’s going to be a fun night.”</p><p>She jokingly compared the Leading Ladies Lunch to the Fight Club, in which you hear about it but don’t speak about it. Sharon even recalled never seeing pictures of it before. The soap star even wondered if it existed or if it was made up. She can’t wait to join the following Leading Ladies at lunch.</p><p><img alt="Sharon Case" width=800 height=567 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/06/sharon-case-breaks-silence-on-first-ever-lead-actress-nomination/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Sharon Case Breaks Silence On First-Ever Lead Actress Nomination" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sharon-Case-2.jpg></p><h3>Shares Praise For Y&R Fanbase</h3><p><a href=#>During the interview,</a> Sharon Case also shared her praise for her fans, who supported her throughout the years. Some of them are “diehards” who have watched her from the beginning of The Young and the Restless. Sharon was speechless and tried to come up with the right words to say.</p><p>“I love feeling their support, I love hearing it, and I want them to know that I love them back,” Sharon Case explained. “I love them, too. I support them, as well. I’m glad they’re there to support the shows and the characters, and it’s a mutual effort.”</p><p>She comes across some of the Y&R fans on social media. Sharon has gotten to know their names and their faces. She mentioned that there should be daytime or soap award shows where the viewers have control. Or, they could come up with a category for “Best Fan” or “Biggest Fan.”</p><p>What are your thoughts on Sharon Case receiving her first-ever Leading Actress nomination?<a href=#> Do you think it’s a long time coming?
