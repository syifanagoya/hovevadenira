Nothing is known about her.</strong></p><p>Benzino is an American rapper, television personality, record producer, and an Urban contemporary music mogul. He is also the most popular parent of Coi Leray. The relationship dynamic between Coi Leray and her parents will make an interesting read.</p><h2><strong>Coi Leray’s Dad, Raymond Leon Scott aka Ray Benzino, is a Rapper</strong></h2><p>Raymond Leon Scott, who you may know better as Ray Benzino or Coi Leray’s dad, was born on the 18th of July 1965 in Boston, Massachusetts USA. He is one of the co-founders of The Source magazine and one of the founding members of the rap groups ‘Made Men’ and the ‘Almighty RSO’. Since 2012, he has been featured in the reality TV show Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta.</p><p>Benzino is best known for his feud with Eminem which began in 2003 after The Source magazine gave Eminem’s show a 4 mic rating instead of a 5 mic as desired by Eminem. According to Eminem, the magazine and Benzino gave him an unfair rating.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/benzino-1800-1396199950-1.jpg alt="Coi Leray Parents" width=696 height=486 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In response to Eminem, Benzino released two diss tracks titled Die Another Day and Pull Your Skirt Up where he called Eminem a “2003 Vanilla Ice”. Eminem who could not take the insult laying low released two counter diss tracks titled The Sauce and Nail in the Coffin.Not ready to back down, Benzino released the diss mixtape “Benzino Presents: Die Another Day: Flawless Victory.”</p><p>Benzino has been in the entertainment industry since 1989 and has released 4 studio albums, including The Benzino Project, The Antidote, Redemption, and Arch Nemesis. The urban complementary music mogul has also released up to seven mixtapes among which are Welcome to Texaco City with OJ da Juiceman, Crushed Ice, and The Magnificent 757’s with Stevie J, to mention but a few.</p><h2><strong>What We Know About Coi Leray’s Mother</strong></h2><p>The name, date of birth, and age of Coi Leray’s mother has not been revealed to the media. What we know about her is that before she got married to Benzino, she had two sons. According to Coi’s report, her mother has been very supportive of her from the time she was a child and even now that she has become a successful rapper.</p><p>Judging from some of the issues that have erupted between Coi Leray and her dad in recent times, it doesn’t really look like Benzino and Coi’s mom are on the best terms.</p><h2><strong>Coi Leray’s Parents Are Divorced</strong></h2><p>Coi Leray’s parents were previously married, however, details about how they met, their wedding, and what really transpired in their marriage are not available to the public. During an interview with Power 105.1’s Breakfast Club on the 6th of April 2022, Coi Leray mentioned that after her father left The Source, he became broke and life was not so easy for them.</p><p>According to Coi, people think she was raised with a silver spoon, but that was not always the case. Her dad became broke when she was nine years old. It was hard for her and she needed to understand that life was not so easy. It was also during this period that Benzino and Coi’s mom got divorced. After the divorce, Coi Leray and her five brothers were raised by her mom.</p><h3><strong>Coi Leray Used To Give Her Father Credit For Inspiring Her Music Career</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Benzino-Threatening-Her-Her-Mom-The-Devil-Is-Working.jpg alt="Coi Leray Parents" width=696 height=658 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Coi Leray started her career in 2018 and at that time , she was known to have a good relationship with her father. In September 2020, while speaking at the No Jumper podcast, she referred to her father as one of her biggest inspirations. According to her, her father taught her how to grind hard.</p><p>She said Benzino is the type of man who will keep doing music even if nobody is listening to him. He would always say that even if his music was being played on the radio or if nobody was listening to him, he would always make music and was never going to stop.</p><h3><strong>By 2021, The Relationship Between Coi Leray and Benzino Went South</strong></h3><p>It was a surprise to everyone when Coi Leray accused her father of being unsupportive in the remix of No More Parties. This was because she used to praise him for being her inspiration. In her lyrics, she rapped, “My daddy let me down, but I promise you, I won’t let up. I wanna say fuck that man but the shit won’t make me better.”</p><p>Benzino, who is not new to having an open feud with others publicly took to Instagram to say that his daughter was lying in her lyrics because he has always been there for her and will always be there for her. He even blamed her mother for being the cause of their issues.</p><p>In response to the things her father said, Coi Leray took to Instagram to say that her father does not appreciate her music and that he is someone who burns all his bridges.</p><p>Just when fans thought they had heard enough from father and daughter, Coi Leray went on Twitter to reveal that her father once told her that he wished she was a boy. She even revealed that she was embarrassed to be his daughter.</p><h3><strong>Benzino Blamed Coi’s Mother More For Trying To Ruin His Relationship With His Daughter</strong></h3><p>In response to everything Coi Leray said about Benzino on Twitter, he responded by blaming her mother. He claimed that his ex-wife was poisoning his children’s hearts against him but that it wasn’t a new thing. He said once the man leaves a marriage the mothers begin to tell their children all sorts of things.</p><p>After Benzino’s response, the duo deleted all the hurtful tweets and Instagram posts they had made about each other and since then, we have not heard from them.</p><h3><strong>Benzino Was Offended That Coi Leray Revealed He Was Broke</strong></h3><p>The relationship between Benzino and Coi Leray disintegrated after the latter’s interview with Power 105.1’s Breakfast Club. According to Coi, he started texting to threaten her and her mother. This was a very sad moment for Coi Leray because it was around the same time she was about to drop her debut album ‘Trendsetter’.</p><p>She wasn’t pleased to know that a day before her album release, her dad was angry that she said he was broke. While everyone was sending in their congratulations, he didn’t even congratulate her.</p><p>Coi Leray took to Twitter to reveal that everything was working so well and the devil wanted to ruin it all and it seemed like her inference of “the devil” was targeted at her father. In her words, “he is trying to fuck everyone’s life up.”</p><p>She went on to add in her tweet that her mother is always trying to support her, whereas her dad is always seeking ways to create beef. She also called her father “bitter and evil” and promised to pray for him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunCvzqJkpZ2ilsZuvMCrnKeso2K6prHTZp%2Beql2ZrqV5wKebZqWfonw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./masiela-lusha-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Masiela Lusha Net Worth 2024: A Deep Dive into Career, Earnings and Financial Journey</span></a>
