He was a fave.”</p><p id=ehIeFt30Tgw data-wc=41>Recalling her late husband Michael’s reaction when she was first offered the part of M, the audience erupted in laughter when she told Finty: “Your father said, ‘You can’t possibly turn it down, I want to live with a Bond woman’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c4d3087d8730-lmphoedemajg-026.jpg><p id=eo1SWMLrPL8 data-wc=57>"I have a wonderful memory of being in the first film (Goldeneye) with Piers Brosnan which was his first one too.
