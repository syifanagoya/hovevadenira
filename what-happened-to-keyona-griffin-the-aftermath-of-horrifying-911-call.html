Cherletta Baber-Bey and her lover, 47-year-old “Jay,” shared a residence.</p><p>A horrifying tragedy struck the family last month, resulting in a massacre. Here’s everything we know so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Keyona_Griffin></span>Who is Keyona Griffin?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Keyona Griffin</a> is the woman who called 911 to report her aunt’s death and her possible murder. Three Grand Rapids Police officers arrived at 553 Sheldon seven minutes and 41 seconds after the call between Keyona and 911 ended.</p><p>The Grand Rapids Police Department released bodycam video of the officers’ arrival. They failed after numerous attempts to enter the house and did not attempt to contact anyone in the interim.</p><p>The police in Grand Rapids never made contact with anyone inside the house. They departed three minutes and 42 seconds after arriving. Two hours and 18 minutes later, 911 dispatchers received a second call from the same residence.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=911_response></span>911 response <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>47-year-old Cherletta Baber-Bey was discovered in her bed unconscious. She was propped up on a cushion, wearing headphones and holding an iPad that was still playing. A bullet had struck her in the back of the head.</p><p>According to Target 8, Cherletta’s family described her as a loving, trustworthy, and lovely woman who avoided social situations. “Jay” was her first true love, and they spent the majority of their time together in her bedroom.</p><p>During the murder investigation, detectives discovered a box of letters in Cherletta’s closet. Between her and Derrell Brown, it was a series of “prison letters.” In those letters, Derrell stated that he went by the name “Jay.” It was the signature on every letter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Keyona_Griffin_Death_Has_the_suspect_been_arrested></span>Keyona Griffin Death: Has the suspect been arrested?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, the suspected murderer has not yet been apprehended.</p><p>In the days following the murders, the Grand Rapids Police Department released a transcript of Keyona Griffin’s frantic 911 call hours before the murders, but access to the actual audio was restricted.</p><p>Target 8 investigators tried once more in October 2021. The 911 audio and police report was gotten through the Freedom of Information Act in order to draw attention to the four-year-long global manhunt for the killer.</p><p>Brown, on the other hand, is still on the loose, most likely hiding in plain sight.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=911_releases_Keyona_Griffin_call></span>911 releases Keyona Griffin call<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading></h2><p>“I need help,” whispered the 911 caller.https://d-3602260623682659407.ampproject.net/2207281718002/frame.html</p><p>“Hello?” asked the emergency dispatcher.</p><p>“I need help,” the woman repeated.</p><p>“OK, where are you located?” asked the emergency dispatcher.</p><p>I’m sorry, ma’am, I can’t hear you,” the 911 operator said.</p><p>“I know,” whispered the woman.</p><p>The call came in to Grand Rapids police dispatch at 10:25 a.m. Wednesday, March 13, 2019.</p><p>“553 Sheldon Avenue SE… Please hurry now,” the woman pleaded, her whisper a little louder and more urgent now.</p><p>“553 Sheldon. OK. Can you tell me what’s going on there?” asked the 911 operator.</p><p>“Can you just hurry up, please,” the caller said. “I’m fittin’ to die… He’s tryin’ to kill me. He already killed my auntie. Can you hurry up, please?”</p><p>“Okay, ma’am. I’ll start the police that way. Can you tell me what your name is?” asked the dispatcher.</p><p>“Keyona,” she whispered, seconds before the call disconnected.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_is_Derrell_Brown></span>Where is Derrell Brown?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Grand Rapids Police Department released a transcript of Keyona Griffin’s desperate 911 call hours before the murders in the days following the killings, but GRPD denied access to the call’s actual audio.</p><p>Target 8 investigators tried again in October 2021. We obtained the 911 audio and police report using the Freedom of Information Act in an effort to bring attention to the nationwide manhunt for the killer, which is now in its fourth year.</p><p>In July 2021, US Marshals “intensified” their search efforts by designating Derrell Demon Brown, 47, as one of the country’s 15 most wanted criminals.</p><p>Brown, on the other hand, is still on the loose, most likely hiding in plain sight.</p><p>He looks very unassuming and could literally be standing behind you in a grocery checkout lane,” said Bruce Nordin, the acting U.S. marshal of the District of Western Michigan.</p><p>The FBI believes Brown, now 48, fled the state after the murders and is receiving help from family or associates. He grew up in Grand Rapids and graduated from high school there, but he also has relatives in Ohio, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia.</p><p>A $25,000 reward is currently being offered for information leading to his arrest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkZ63or%2FUqZyrnpGjwG%2BvzqZmsKCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGLBsHnKnrCoppFitLO1xZ%2Bgp2WknbJurcWtnKulkam1brvFZp%2BoqqKes7q1zaBkcmlhYrCiuMto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./648f8d12ca4741d84e8b45b0-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mxico vs Panam: Aficin abandona al Tri en Las Vegas con estadio &amp;quot;vaco&amp;quot; - La reaccin de los</span></a>
