Then you’re definitely in luck because there are bushels of Witcher-related gifts for all the Geralts and Yennefers in your life.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>Whether you’re a fan of the video games, the show, or both, there’s enough Witcher-related merchandise around to keep even your grumpiest Vesemir-like friend happy. There are books, action figures, jewelry and even coloring books available for purchase.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>With so many things to choose from, it can get a little overwhelming. Let us guide you through the commercial world of The Witcher merchandise so you won’t end up empty handed and defeated like every monster that comes in contact with Geralt’s sword.</p><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=37 data-injectable=false>Let’s start with the easy ones.</p><h2 id=h-a-netflix-subscription data-injectable=false>A Netflix subscription</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-16.png><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>If you want to get someone interested in the show, one of the best ways to go about that is by gifting them a Netflix subscription, so they can watch the show themselves.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>You don’t have to pay for a year or anything. Just give someone your password, and gift them their own profile. Once they watch the show, change your password. When they ask, make up an elaborate story about your pet needing surgery or something and change the subject.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Seriously though. The best Witcher gift you can give someone is turning them on to the show, which is much better than it has any business being.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The game</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Geralt-in-The-Witcher.jpg><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>This is a phenomenal gift for someone who loves the show and has never played the video game. By video game, we mean The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt. Sure, two other games came before it, but they were nowhere near as influential.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>The majority of the base material for the show comes from this incredible game. It’s an open-world RPG where you basically do what happens in the show. The game has sold more than 10 million copies, and it’s widely considered one of the best games of all time.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>If you’ve never played it, stop whatever you’re doing and buy this game. It’s been around a while, and it’s not expensive anymore. Do it! Oh, and get the Complete Edition with the DLC included.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Geralt in Bath figure</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-18.png><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>Anyone who familiar with Geralt knows he loves baths. Buy this a figurine referencing an iconic scene found at the beginning of The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt for all those bath enthusiasts out there who also happen to love The Witcher.</p><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=121 data-injectable=false>The figure is made of resin and comes in a sweet, officially licensed box. Here’s the official product description:</p><p>“Originally an in-game scene, turned internet meme, turned CD Projekt Red April Fools joke, the demand that this be brought to life from Witcher fans became too great to bear. Dark Horse is proud to bring you this marvelously detailed, hand-painted Polynesian statuette featuring Geralt of Rivia relaxing and healing from his perilous journeys, in a candlelit bath, complete with his rubber ducky!”</p><p data-characters=41 data-current-count=41 data-injectable=false>You can purchase Geralt in the bath <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The comics</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-19.png><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>I know what you’re thinking—there are a lot of Witcher comics out there, so where to start? This is the perfect place to dip your toe into the illustrated world of the universe. This collection features issues #1–#5 of&nbsp;The Witcher&nbsp;comic series&nbsp;House of Glass,&nbsp;Fox Children,&nbsp;Curse of Crows, and the&nbsp;Killing Monsters&nbsp;one-shot with annotations from the creators of the comics as well as a sketchbook section.”</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>It’s written by Eisner award-winning author Paul Tobin, who “pens a fantasy epic of the adventures of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher—one of the few remaining monster hunters from the critically acclaimed video game fantasy&nbsp;The Witcher&nbsp;by CD Projekt Red!”</p><p data-characters=83 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>You can either purchase the physical book or get the digital version for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">much less</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Witcher wallet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-20.png><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>For when you want to carry your coin around in style, there’s this handsome and well-made wallet with the Witcher 3 insignia branded on the front of it. Open it up, and it has The Witcher Wild Hunt stitched in the interior.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>It’s honestly pretty stylish and a good flex for when you’re at GameStop or the mall and want to impress someone with your level of fandom. The wallet has a polyurethane lining and has five card pockets and a see-through ID window pocket.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Here’s the official product description: “Store your Crown, Oren, or whatever preferred currency, in this fine travelling pouch. You’ll never have to turn down a bribe or gamble with your gold safely by your side.”</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>It’s officially licensed by CD Projekt Red, too, and it comes in black and brown. The black one has a silver logo which looks incredible, but the inside logo isn’t as visible. The brown is the opposite; the outside logo is less striking but the inside logo really pops. Buy it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Replica sword</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-21.png><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>Everyone knows that really cool guys <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">live by the blade</a> while other people waste time socializing, having sex, or working out. Even if you’re not the coolest around, you can still get a replica of Geralt’s sword so you can at least feel cool.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>You’ll be studying the blade in no time with this stainless steel replica monster murderer. Wait. Scratch that. It’s only meant for humans, per the item’s description:</p><p>“Replica of Witcher Geralt of Rivia’s Steel Sword. According to lore, the steel sword is used to slay humans and mortal enemies. Stainless steel with hardwood handle wrapped in leather. 124cm. Comes with high quality leather wrapped wooden scabbard with zinc alloy fittings, as well as a buckled leather back strap. 1.9kg.

Buy it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Witcher pint glass set</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-22.png><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>What better way is there to play a Witcher-themed drinking game than with these official Witcher pint glasses? There’s not. For the drinking enthusiast in your life (you know a few), these well-made and officially licensed pint glasses will help take you to dreamland.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>Need a drinking game idea? Here’s a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">good one</a>: Take a sip when Geralt says “hmmm” or groans, rolls his eyes or talks about Roach. Take a big sip when he gets hurt, uses magic, or kisses someone. Finish your drink when a monster dies (one per type) or during, “Toss a coin to your witcher.” Be warned, he grunts a lot, so you will be drunk fairly quickly. Drink responsibly. Buy the glasses <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. They’re unfortunately not cheap.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Witcher flask set</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-23.png><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>Not to keep on the drinking theme for too long but this is, for the right person, the coolest gift on this list. It’s faux leather bound, has the Wild Hunt logo and even comes with two little silver cups, so you can share in between monster slaying with your replica sword.</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>It’s made of steel and holds eight ounces of whatever you want to put inside it. Here’s the official product description:</p><p>“Everyone could use a good drink after fighting off a Berserker or slaughtering an Alghoul. Share a shot with comrades with this deluxe Witcher flask set. Comes complete with an 8 oz.

It’s stylish and stitched with a striking white wolf logo that’s for sure going to impress fellow Witcher fans and alienate potential dates who don’t watch the show. Then again, who would date someone who doesn’t watch The Witcher?</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false>It’s made of acrylic, wool, and spandex and has universal sizing. You can finally sport the white wolf with whatever outfit you choose to wear that day. Buy it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Witcher pocket watch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-25.png><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>Absolutely and unequivocally one of the neatest items on this list. This watch is made with brass to give it that antique feel, and it’s beautifully engraved all over. The details are what make this thing sing and it comes with a necklace in case you want to wear it as one.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>It’s also a little water resistant, but not totally (no bathing or swimming with it on). Inside the watch is Japanese quartz movement and beautiful Arabic numerals. This is a one-of-a-kind gift that would make even the grumpiest Witcher fan go “hmmmm.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Witcher Adult Coloring Book</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-26.png><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>What better way to connect with your inner child than with a graphic and bloody adult coloring book?
