The real Lindsay was generously loving and caring towards everyone – me, our kids, family, friends, and her patients,” Patrick Clancy wrote Saturday in a GoFundMe post.</p><p>“The very fibers of her soul are loving. All I wish for her now is that she can somehow find peace.”</p><p>On Tuesday evening, medics were called to the family’s residence after Patrick Clancy arrived home and found the children unconscious. The two oldest kids, 5-year-old Cora Clancy and 3-year-old Dawson Clancy, were later declared deceased at a hospital.</p><p>Authorities said Friday that the couple’s third and youngest child, 8-month-old Callan Clancy, also died.</p><p></p><p>Lindsay Clancy has been charged with two counts of murder, three counts of strangulation or suffocation and three counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. She is expected to also be charged in connection with Callan’s death.</p><p>Police have Lindsay in custody and she is under supervision at a Boston-area hospital. She had attempted suicide before Patrick found her Tuesday evening, according to WCVB-TV.</p><p>Investigators are exploring whether Lindsay Clancy was dealing with postpartum psychosis at the time of the slayings, WBZ-TV reports. She reportedly worked as a nurse at Massachusetts General Hospital but was on leave.</p><p>In the GoFundMe post, Patrick Clancy reflected on his family and life as a father.</p><p>“My family was the best thing that ever happened to me,” Patrick Clancy wrote in the GoFundMe post. “I took so much pride in being Lindsay’s husband and a dad to Cora, Dawson, and Callan. I always reminded myself that each day with them was a new gift.</p><p>“Callan usually woke up first and would rest his head on my shoulder for a few minutes as he adjusted to morning. Dawson typically sang or spoke his thoughts out loud for a while before we’d go get him. Cora was a big girl and would simply walk downstairs. I can still vividly picture her coming into the living room each morning with her hair in a mess, smile on her face.”</p><p>He added that the family would “always started our days together, reading books, cuddling up on the couch, and playing with magnet tiles. I loved taking them places, whether it was scooting at Chandler elementary, vacation, skiing, out on the boat, or to Duxbury Beach, one of our favorite places on earth. They gave me purpose and I never took it for granted. There is now a massive void where that purpose once was.”</p><p>Patrick Clancy also talked about his wife in the GoFundMe post, sharing how the couple met and moments from their day-to-day lives.</p><p>“I want to share some thoughts about Lindsay. She’s recently been portrayed largely by people who have never met her and never knew who the real Lindsay was. Our marriage was wonderful and diametrically grew stronger as her condition rapidly worsened.</p><p>“I took as much pride in being her husband as I did in being a father and felt persistently lucky to have her in my life,” Patrick Clancy wrote in the GoFundMe post. “I still remember the very moment I first laid eyes on her and can recall how overcome I was with the kind of love at first sight you only see in movies.</p><p>“It really didn’t take long before I was certain I wanted to marry her. We said ‘I love you’ to each other multiple times daily, as if it were a reflex. We habitually started every morning with a passionate hug, yielding a sigh of relief like we had each received the perfect medicine.</p><p>“If too much time passed with out a hug, she’d look at me and ask: ‘Did you forget?’ We mutually understood the reality that people can have bad days, but we stuck to the rule that when one of us got lost, the other was always there to bring them home, always.”</p><p>On Thursday, the Duxbury community held a candlelight vigil at a church that focused on mental health, according to Boston.com. Hundreds of people attended.</p><p>If you or someone you know is considering suicide or self-harm, call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 800-273-8255 or visit 988lifeline.org.</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news,&nbsp;subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.</strong></p><p>Join Nancy Grace for her new online video series designed to help you protect what you love most — your children.</p><p>[Feature Photo: Lindsay Clancyc, Cora Clancy, and Dawson Clancy/Facebook]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX53CtK7Ap5tmq5GuwG60xGadqKqXnsOmv4ywoJ%2BdXay1sHnMrqmdnaKasW7Ax56gq2Wknb%2BmsYyypq6ml2KwqbXLnamepl2Yv6q5xGamp6SZo7Jw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kareem-cadet-fashion-designer.html><span>←</span><span>Kareem Cadet (Fashion Designer): What Happend To Him?
