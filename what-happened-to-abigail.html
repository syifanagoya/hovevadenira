It’s not a huge surprise between Chad’s visit in April, Mother’s Day in May and the upcoming anniversary of her death in June. But whenever it happens, we’re always wondering if there’s more to the mentions than meets the eye and if we’ll be seeing her return to life once more.</p><p>But now, new revelations on the show’s Wednesday, May 15th episode have us questioning not her possible return to life, but what happened with her death. And we’re honestly kind of confused. <a href=# rel=noopener>(You can read the recap here.)</a></p><p>You see, we got what we think is meant to be an entirely new twist to her saga when Nicole accidentally came across Abigail’s secret journal at The Spectator. After flipping through (and calling Abigail’s dad, Jack), Chad deduced that his wife was working on a big story revolving around Clyde’s drug ring when she was killed.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/chad-finds-abby-dead-days-jj.jpg alt="In their bedroom, an anguished Chad hovers his hands over Abigail's lifeless body, sprawled over their bed" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“The question is,” Chad then mused, “did Clyde know about it?”</p><p>And <i>our </i>question is… does that matter? We already know what happened to Abigail — Clyde killed her! He was thrown in jail for her murder after confessing that he’d gone to the DiMera mansion to kill Belle. EJ, you see, had told her that Clyde was the one who had shot and “killed” him a little while back and Clyde had heard that after planting a bug in the DiMera mansion.</p><p>He knew Belle would be coming after him, so he decided to go after her first. He’d eliminate the new threat and use it to cow EJ into keeping quiet. Instead, he was surprised to run across Abigail and, unable to come up with a good excuse as to why he was in her home, stabbed her in the stomach, killing her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/chad-grabs-clyde-days-peacock.png alt="Outside at night, a glowering Chad stands behind Clyde and grips his shoulder" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>We even got a flashback to the night. So what’s the point in saying Abigail was investigating him when she died and pondering if he knew about it? Are they retconning the reason Clyde killed her? If so, to what end? What’s the point in bringing Abigail into this?</p><p>At the time, she was riding high. She and Chad were planning on having another baby. Gwen was locked safely away in prison. So maybe saying Abigail was on the verge of taking Clyde down and almost averted all the tragedy that followed is meant to add more weight to her death.</p><p>Maybe it’s meant to push Chad over the edge to finally be the one to pull the trigger on Clyde and put him in the ground. Maybe there’s something more going on.</p><p>What are your thoughts? Why is the past between Abigail and Clyde changing now? Is there some hidden reason in there as to why she might still be alive?
