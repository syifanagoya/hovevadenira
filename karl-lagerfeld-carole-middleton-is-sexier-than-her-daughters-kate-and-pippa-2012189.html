(The Party Pieces co-owner, 57, and husband Michael are parents to Kate, 30, Pippa, 28, and <strong>James</strong>, 25). "I think the mother is sexier than the daughters. There is something full of life about her. For a woman who must be 50 or so I think she's great. Full of energy."</p><p>During his chat with the mag, the eccentric, 78-year-old designer — who recently celebrated the launch of his cosmetics collaboration with Shu Uemura — also took the opportunity to clarify his comments about Carole's youngest daughter, Pippa. (He told The Sun earlier this year that he doesn't "like [Pippa's] face. She should only show her back.")</p><p>Lagerfeld says he only meant Pippa could use a bit of help with her cosmetics choices. "I didn't mean that!" he explains. "I only meant I don't think her makeup is right. She has a roundish face and round eyes and she should pick another makeup for the eyes."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Once Pippa gets the makeover he thinks she so desperately needs, Lagerfeld is eager to get his hands on another famous face: Duchess Kate herself.</p><p>"I love Kate Middleton!" he gushed. "She can try anything. For makeup, she has no limits!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaKheq2txp6pn52cmXqkrdGoo55lnZ6xpbjEraanZZmoerSx16Kcq2Wkna6veceeqWackaq0qcDEq6pmo5Gpsm6tzZ1kqaGgpa5ufo9qaWpwaWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jinder-mahal-big-sky.html><span>←</span><span>Jinder Mahal Is on 'Big Sky'!
