To help you get there, we’ve curated this list of the best lotions for stretch marks in 2024. You’re welcome!</p><h2><strong>What Causes Stretch Marks?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Basically, stretch marks are scars that come from skin stretching or shrinking quickly, such as with a pregnancy or extreme weight loss. When your skin is pushed to its limits or shrunk too fast, the collagen and elastin in your skin break. In the healing process, the scars we know as stretch marks form. It’s not just the marks you have to worry about, but also skin irritation and itching around them, too. Not everyone gets stretch marks to the same degree –</p><p>factors like genetics, how much stretching the skin has to do, and even hormones can affect how visible your stretch marks are.</p><h2><strong>Do Stretch Marks Go Away?</strong></h2><p>While stretch marks are permanent, at the very least they should fade on their own. If they don’t, luckily there are many treatment options to make them less noticeable and uncomfortable.</p><h2><strong>How to Treat Stretch Marks&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Here are the ways you can go about improving the appearance of stretch marks:</p><ul><li aria-level=1><strong>Laser Treatment</strong>. Laser skin resurfacing is a procedure that dermatologists can use to fade stretch marks. It involves the doctor directing laser beams at your skin, removing the skin to encourage new skin production to take place. You can notice some effects immediately and even more changes to your skin over time.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Microneedling</strong>. This is just what it sounds like – a dermatologist will poke your skin with tiny needles to stimulate collagen growth to create newer, firmer skin. It may take several microneedling treatments to see results.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Dermabrasion</strong>. In dermabrasion surgery, a dermatologist will scrape the stretch marked skin away, revealing smoother skin. Results appear within weeks, but there is an initial healing period beforehand.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Products to Use at Home</strong>. If an in-office procedure sounds like too much, the good news is that you can start with products to use at home, like lotions, butters, and creams specially designed to fade stretch marks! Products like the ones we’ve included on our list.</li></ul><h2><strong>What to Look for in Lotions for Stretch Marks</strong></h2><p>When searching for lotions to fade your stretch marks, look for the following helpful ingredients:</p><ul><li aria-level=1><strong>Retinol</strong>. Retinoids come from vitamin A, and when they seep into skin help encourage collagen production while exfoliating, leaving smoother looking skin behind. This ingredient is particularly effective on new stretch marks that are under a few months old.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Hyaluronic Acid</strong>. This powerful moisturizer helps heal skin and plump it up, reducing the severity of stretch marks. Since hyaluronic acid is great for making skin more elastic, it’s a good idea to apply it to the affected area while the stretching is happening to prevent marks from forming.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Centella</strong>. Centella Asiatica is an herb that is popular in scar treatments. That’s because it helps to soothe inflammation and get your skin to produce more collagen, improving the look of scar tissue.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Coconut Oil</strong>. Use coconut oil on skin to reinforce the moisture barrier and promote skin healing. While there is only anecdotal, rather than scientific, evidence to support coconut oil’s role in helping stretch marks, it certainly won’t hurt skin, so go ahead and rub it in.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Aloe Vera</strong>. Aloe vera is a known skin soother that is often used to help heal wounds and scrapes of all kinds, so it makes sense that this would be a good match for stretch marks.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Shea Butter</strong>. Shea butter is an ideal ingredient for stretch marks, as it helps to fade their redness and make skin stronger and healthier. Its vitamins and fatty acids increase collagen production, plus the ingredient provides UV protection.</li></ul><h3><strong>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Lotion</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image6-3.png alt="Blu Atlas Lotion" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>This rejuvenating lotion from Blu Atlas has all you need to fade stretch marks, nourish skin, and keep it soothed and moisturized for the rest of time. Its formula blends powerful naturally-derived ingredients and comes in three scent options to match all different needs. There is unscented for those with super sensitive skin, or the natural Coconut Apricot and Classic scents. Coconut Apricot is rather sweet and tropical, while Classic is energizing and fresh.</p><p>Now for the ingredients that make this one of the best lotions for stretch marks. There’s shea butter, a favorite ingredient for stretch marks that gently heals and nourishes. Then jojoba oil kicks in, delivering vitamins A, D, and E plus fatty acids and antioxidants to help skin recover from stretching. Seaweed works on your skin’s luminosity with its own combination of micronutrients, and squalane fights inflammation while enhancing the skin barrier.</p><p><strong>Best For:</strong> All skin types, including sensitive skin.</p><h3><strong>2. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cocoa Butter Massage Lotion for Stretch Marks</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image5-4.png alt="Cocoa Butter Massage Lotion for Stretch Marks" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>This massage lotion has been a go-to for healing mamas forever, and why mess with a good thing? It’s a non-greasy formula that boosts your skin’s elasticity to help it bounce back from all that stretching, plus it contains important butters, oils, and vitamins to improve skin health.</p><p>Cocoa butter and shea butter are the main characters of this formula, working together on skin to help it become plump and well-nourished. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant sure to fade stretch marks, lutein supports your skin as it heals from stretching, and a blend of argan, coconut, and almond oils softens and reduces the appearance of scars. There are other helpful ingredients in here, too, like elastin, palm oil, and cornstarch.</p><p><strong>Best For:</strong> Those with dry skin. It may not be suitable for anyone with sensitive skin due to fragrance and PEGs.</p><h3><strong>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mutha Body Butter</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image8-4.png alt="Mutha Body Butter" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>100% ingredients of natural origins go into this body butter, which was designed to help the skin of new mothers recover quickly and lovingly. It’s clinically shown to support the balance of skin tone and blur discoloration, plus it gives you two whole days of satisfying moisture. This best lotion for stretch marks is a force to be reckoned with!</p><p>Shea, cocoa, and mango butter serve as the driving force behind this product, but it contains other helpful ingredients, too.

It works by keeping skin soft, smooth, and elastic to minimize any discomfort as skin stretches and shrinks.</p><p>One important ingredient is natural fat from the karite tree fruit (shea butter), which provides important nutrients while hydrating and promoting elasticity, helping your skin to hold its form and bounce back quickly. A trifecta of sweet almond, sunflower, and coconut oils keeps skin calm, cocoa, and jojoba butter promote healing, and tocopherol protects skin.</p><p><strong>Best For:</strong> Expectant mothers with sensitive skin.</p><h3><strong>5. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mama Mio Tummy Rub Butter</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image10-4.png alt="Mama Mio Tummy Rub Butter" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Not all skincare products are safe to use during pregnancy, and as your hormones shift your skin becomes more sensitive, too. That’s why it’s important to find products designed especially for people who are pregnant, like this Tummy Rub Butter from Mama Mio. It is enriched with tons of omega fatty acids to prevent stretch marks and then help them heal, and is safe to use during and after pregnancy.
