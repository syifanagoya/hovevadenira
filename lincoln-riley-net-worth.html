He was operating under a six-year $45 million deal.</p><p>In November 2021 a random Twitter account claimed that Lincoln had signed an absolutely astonishing deal to become the coach of the USC Trojans. According to the tweet, the total deal value was $110 million with all bonuses and incentives. Furthermore, USC paid $500,000 over asking price for his two Oklahoma homes and agreed to buy him a $6 million home in Los Angeles. USC also supposedly give him unlimited use of the school's private jet:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Lincoln Riley USC contract details (not confirmed; best I could do):</p><p>– $110 million</p><p>– USC buying both his homes in Norman for $500,000 over asking ($1 million bonus)</p><p>– Buying a $6 million home in LA for him</p><p>– Unlimited use of the private jet 24/7 for family<a href=#>#Sooners</a> <a href=#>#Trojans</a></p><p>— Robert Hefner V (@RobertHefnerV) <a href=#>November 29, 2021</a></p><p>Unfortunately it was soon clarified that none of the above claims were official and the Twitter user is not an recognized source of verified information. In reality, Lincoln's contract details may never be revealed since USC is a private institution. It is generally believed that USC would have been forced to pay Lincoln at least $4.5 million to buyout one year of his Oklahoma contract and his annual average salary is likely in the $8-10 million range.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In March 2022, Lincoln Riley reportedly paid $17.2 million for an ocean view mansion in Palos Verdes Estates, just south of Los Angeles.&nbsp; The 13,000 square-foot mansion has 7 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms.
