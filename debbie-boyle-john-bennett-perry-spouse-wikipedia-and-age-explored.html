His parents, John Bennett Perry and Suzanne Perry (née Langford), were quite young when they welcomed their son into the world.</p><p>However, their youthful love story was not without its struggles, and they eventually divorced when Matthew was just one year old. In a 2004 interview with Katie Couric on NBC News, Matthew expressed that he didn’t blame himself for their separation.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Post-Divorce_Years></span>The Post-Divorce Years<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Following the divorce, Suzanne and Matthew relocated from Massachusetts to Ottawa, Canada.

Throughout the 1970s and ’80s, he gained recognition as the face of Old Spice commercials.</p><p>Young Matthew primarily saw his father on television screens, whether it was getting shot through a door on shows like Mannix.

It was a near-fatal experience that changed his perspective.</p><p>During the interview, Matthew revealed that he came close to losing his life in 2018.</p><p>He was hospitalized for a perforated bowel, which led to a paralyzed digestive system. After several days in the hospital, he developed pneumonia and fell into a two-week coma, followed by several more months in the hospital. He survived, but the scare had a profound impact on his parents.</p><p>Matthew recounted, “One of the things I have to deal with is that my family rushed to the hospital and were told that I have a 2 percent chance to make it through the night. You know, my mom heard that, and my dad heard that.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_New_Beginning></span>A New Beginning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Since his coma, Matthew declared that he is “no longer mired in an impossible battle with drugs and alcohol.” He expressed a desire to move forward with his life and announced his aspiration to become a father.</p><p>Matthew Perry stated, “I’m not run by the fear I used to be run by, so everything’s kind of different.
