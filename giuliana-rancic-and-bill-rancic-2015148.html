News host <strong>Giuliana Rancic</strong> and her husband, the first Apprentice winner, <strong>Bill Rancic</strong>, opened the doors to their gorgeous Chicago brownstone to <a href=#>Traditional Home</a> magazine in its September 2015 issue.</p><p>“We have such a rich social life in Chicago,” Giuliana told the mag of the midwestern city. “That just wasn’t the case in Los Angeles—it seemed like one giant office with great weather.”</p><p>Her husband, who was born and raised in the Windy City, echoed G’s sentiments. “This city has everything to offer, including a community of people with strong Midwestern values,” the entrepreneur gushed. “We knew the family who lived here before, and they put a great vibe in this house that we hope to continue. We’ve always had one foot here, and now we have two. Finally, we’re home.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=584 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Giuliana Rancic's Living Room" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Indeed, after 14 years in front of the camera, Giuliana signed off from her E! News hosting duties this past Monday, Aug. 10. “And on this note…it’s a wrap. Fourteen years of memories at one show,” the Fashion Police co-host wrote on Instagram, alongside a pic of Bill giving her a huge hug on set. “Fifty more years of memories to be made with my soulmate. Let’s do this @billrancic!!!!!”</p><p>In their next journey together, the reality stars — married since 2007 and parents to 3-year-old son <strong>Duke</strong> — enlisted the help of interior designer <strong>Lonni Paul</strong> to help redesign their 19th century home. Paul brought in aesthetics that mimicked the power couple’s jetsetting lifestyles.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=420 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Giuliana Rancic's Bathroom" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“I used blue in California to tribute the water,” Paul — who designed <a href=#>their home in L.A.’s Brentwood neighborhood</a> — told Traditional Home in its latest issue. “But in this rowhouse, which doesn’t allow light to pour in from either side, the blue functioned as a tool to create light and airiness that wouldn’t read heavy and dull when the sky turned cold and gray.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=516 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Giuliana Rancic's Kitchen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Paul also worked in the couple’s impressive collection of artwork, featuring pieces by both emerging and established artists. In the couple’s breakfast room, a painting of a limo by <strong>Adam McEwen</strong> hangs over the seating area.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=545 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Giuliana Rancic's Dining Room" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“When I began collecting, it was suggested to me that I start with artists from my generation,” Giuliana said of the piece. “In my youth, the limousine represented wealth and status. It was chic to pull up in a stretch limo. Now, the limousine is somewhat archaic, and high-profile event transportation happens in a black SUV.”</p><p>The couple’s spaces reflect their everyday lifestyles. “We debated between glass or mirror fronts on the cabinets,” she said of the master bedroom. “But I don’t keep pieces that I don’t wear. I edit my things often, and knew that the cabinets would be visually organized.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ6irZyerq%2BtjKuYp5uZmHqiusNmmaKknGK%2ForrCoppmamBmgnKAlw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./universitario-vs-sporting-cristal-history.html><span>←</span><span>Universitario vs. Sporting Cristal Historical Head-to-Head</span></a>
