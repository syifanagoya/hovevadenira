Have you ever looked at a celebrity and thought, “Wow, I want their hair”? That’s how I’ve felt about Nicole Kidman since I first laid eyes on her gorgeous auburn strands. Although she’s previously swapped out her natural red for blonde, I’ve still admired how long, thick and healthy her hair always looks."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

That’s how I’ve felt about <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a> since I first laid eyes on her gorgeous auburn strands. Although she’s previously swapped out her natural red for blonde, I’ve still admired how long, thick and healthy her hair always looks.</p><p>Considering maintaining blonde can put a lot of strain on hair, it’s impressive that Kidman’s still has so much vitality. How does she do it? Well, she revealed to <a href=# rel=noopener>New Beauty</a> that the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vegamour Gro Hair Serum</a> has been a mainstay in her routine for years.</p><p><strong>Hurry!

That said, you don’t need to use all three products to see significant results. If your main goal is to thicken your hair and reduce shedding, the serum could do that in as little as 90 days.</p><p>Beyond boosting hair density, the serum may also help <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">speed up new growth and enhance overall shine</a>. The secret lies in the powerhouse ingredients: mung bean and red clover. The former is a native Asian plant that’s rich in biotin, while the latter naturally blocks DHT, a hormone known to trigger hair loss. Together they build up the microbiome of the scalp, creating ideal conditions for hair follicles and strands to thrive.</p><p><strong>Hurry!

After six weeks of use I see a noticeable difference in the thickness of my hair as well as length – I’m frankly shocked because I did not expect it to work at all,” <a href=#>a</a><a href=#>nother reviewer raves</a>. “I am truly amazed and now, I will be a customer for life.”</p><p>Whether you’re experiencing postpartum hair loss or suspect your hair shedding is due to stress, the <a href=#>Vegamour Gro Hair Serum</a> can help.
