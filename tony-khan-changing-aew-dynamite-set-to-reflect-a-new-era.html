The upstart promotion is ready to unveil a brand-new set for its first show of the new year.</p><p>Tony Khan recently revealed some exciting details and new insight into the upcoming new presentation of their show <a href=#>during an interview with Sports Guys Talk Wrestling.</a></p><p>“It’s a sports-based presentation and that’s what we always go for. It’s a great pro wrestling show and we wanted to change the set to reflect a new era, and I think it’s going to be a great look. It’s a great set. It’s still going to be the same great wrestling with new matches and new stories and a lot to look forward to.”&nbsp;</p><p>Khan further elaborated on whether the new set design would be carried over to AEW pay-per-views as well.</p><p>“I think [it] may, but Revolution traditionally has its own color scheme. Traditionally, we’ve had that kind of green futuristic look that will actually flow really well with a set and design we have now. It’s set up for those kind of color changes. With that grid matrix we have now, it’s very consistent, and more similar to Revolution than anything else we have.”</p><p>The new ‘sports-based presentation’ featuring the new AEW set and outlook is set to make its debut on the January 4th edition of AEW Dynamite, possibly beginning a new era for Tony Khan’s promotion.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed readability=2><p>https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tony-khan-aew-jan-3-2023/id1072954958?i=1000592182623</p></figure><p><strong>Do you think AEW making a major change to its presentation will be beneficial for them?
