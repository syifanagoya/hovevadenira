Often known as the <i>"Claw,"</i> Kawhi is a four-time All-Star and has won two <i>Defensive Player of the Year</i> honors. Previously, he played for the <i>San Antonio Spurs</i>, <i>Toronto Raptors</i>, and college basketball for the San Diego State Aztecs.</p><p>Kawhi Anthony Leonard was born on <i>June 29, 1991</i>, in Los Angeles, California, the United States. The youngest of five children, Kawhi grew up with his four sisters. His father <strong>Mark Leonard</strong> was killed in <i>January 2008</i>.

Afterward, Leonard attended San Diego State University.</p><h2>Shares two kids with his longtime Girlfriend</h2><p>The 29-year-old, Kawhi Leonard is in a longtime relationship with his partner, <a href=#><strong>Kishele Shipley</strong></a>. However, their romance is what we call an extremely low-profile celebrity dating. Leonard is off-grid regarding social media. He is neither on Twitter nor on Instagram. Therefore, many essential details about his personal life stay under the radar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/6/Kawhifam-1607237476990.jpg><p>It seems Kawhi and his girlfriend, Kishele began dating during their time at the University. Hence, the couple has been together for over a decade. They share two children. On <i>July 10, 2016</i>, their first child, a daughter named, <strong>Kaliyah Leonard</strong> was born. Likewise in 2019, Shipley gave birth to a son.

He seems protective of his partner and his kids. However, Kawhi's girlfriend has been spotted on a few occasions. She was once seen supporting Leonard in the stands alongside her two sisters.

As Kawhi doesn't brag about his family life, many beautiful ladies thirst for him.
