She has a very unique personality, but WWE wants to pump the brakes on that a little bit.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>TalkSport</a>, Rhea Ripley revealed that she loves tattoos. She wants to become “the most tattooed human ever.” The issue is that WWE banned her from getting any more tats on her upper body. This is why she wears pants so she can get all the tattoos she desires from the waist down.</p><p>“My dream since being a little girls is to be the most tattooed human ever. I just love tattoos, I don’t know why! I’ve always loved them. But, unfortunately for me, WWE isn’t clearing my upper body [for tattoos] – that’s why I wear pants! I got pants so I wouldn’t have to clear my tattoos because you can’t see them. I’m trying to finish my leg sleeves, then hopefully I can convince people to let me get my arm sleeves and other stuff, but we’ll see how that goes,” Ripley said, laughing.<br></p><p>WWE has a lot to consider whenever a Superstar gets ink. Promotional material, video games, and action figures are just scratching the surface.</p><p>They also need to think about a character’s image. Apparently, WWE has something different in mind for Rhea Ripley other than what she might prefer to represent by attaining a collection of endless tattoos.</p><p>February 20, 2020 8:51 am</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
